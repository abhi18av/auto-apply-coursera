# auto-apply-coursera

This is a little `Clojure` program which automates the process for applying for scholarships on Coursera.

I created this program to help me invest in myself through the wonderful and myriad courses on Coursera.

## Usage

I'm using `spacemacs` and the workflow for using this program is mostly REPL driven.
